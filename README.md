# Functionarium

Functionarium is my personal Apple platform playground — a space where I explore and build small, reusable features.

I'm collecting UI samples, animations, utilities, and architectural ideas as I go.

It's where I test ideas, learn through code, and shape tools that might be useful in future projects — for myself, and maybe others too.

The name “Functionarium” comes from *aquarium* — a playful idea of a place where small functions live, swim, and evolve.
